PySimpleMAC
===========
Welcome to PySimpleMAC. PySimpleMAC is a simplified Marker and Cell Method solver for the incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations. The base solver is written in FORTRAN (F90), and we provide you with a wrapper for use in Python.

Please see the [homepage](http://jonkomperda.github.com/PySimpleMAC) for documentation and installation.
