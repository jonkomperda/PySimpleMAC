Welcome to PySimpleMAC's documentation!
=======================================

Introduction
------------
PySimpleMAC is an Open Source Computational Fluid Dynamics Solver. It employs Harlow's `Marker and Cell <http://pof.aip.org/resource/1/pfldas/v8/i12/p2182_s1?isAuthorized=no>`_ discretization scheme to solve the non-dimensional form of the `incompressible Navier-Stokes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations#Incompressible_flow_of_Newtonian_fluids>`_ equations.

The original version of the code, known as `SimpleMAC <https://github.com/jonkomperda/SimpleMAC>`_ was written for a graduate Supercomputing course at University of Illinois at Chicago. It has since been expanded and ported to Python for this project, which is part of a graduate Python class.

PySimpleMAC includes a GUI which produces a real time solution to the `Lid Driven Cavity <http://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Lid-driven_cavity_problem>`_ problem as a benchmark.

Getting PySimpleMAC
-------------------
The source code may be downloaded as a tarball from the `main page <http://jonkomperda.github.com/PySimpleMAC/>`_, however users are strongly encouraged to use Git and contribute to the project. To get the code using Git, you may simply enter the following in the terminal: ::

    $ cd you_source_directory
    $ git clone https://github.com/jonkomperda/PySimpleMAC.git

A great reference for using git may be found `here <http://gitref.org/creating/>`_

Using PySimpleMAC
-----------------
In order to run the example included with PySimpleMAC you must have the following software/packages:

* Compilers

    * `gfortran <http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran>`_
    * `OpenMPI <http://www.open-mpi.org/>`_

* Python Packages

    * `Numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_
    * `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/#>`_
    * `MPI4PY <http://mpi4py.scipy.org/docs/usrman/index.html>`_
    * `PyVTK <http://code.google.com/p/pyvtk/>`_

Once all the dependancies are installed, simply navigate to the PySimpleMAC directory and execute the 'Makefile' and run the example script: ::

    $ cd PySimpleMAC
    $ make
    $ ./runGUIExample.py

PySimpleMAC Modules
