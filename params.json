{"body":"### Welcome to PySimpleMAC\r\nPySimpleMAC is a simplified Marker and Cell Method solver for the incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations. The base solver is written in FORTRAN (F90), and we provide you with a wrapper for use in Python.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nIt's as easy as downloading the source code from one of the above links. Then you need to unzip, and build the code:\r\n```\r\n$ cd py_simple_mac_root/\r\n$ make\r\n$ ./runGUIExample.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see a GUI launch with an example of the common benchmark case: the lid driven cavity.\r\n\r\n### Python Interface\r\nMore advanced users can take advantage of the Python routines which drive the code. Documentation for the Python modules may be found here:\r\n[PySimpleMAC Python Interface Documentation](http://jonkomperda.github.com/PySimpleMAC/pydoc)\r\n\r\n### Developer Documentation\r\nIf you are interested in adding features to the main CFD solver, which is written in Fortran, you may find full Doxygen generated documentation for the code here:\r\n[PySimpleMAC Fortran Developer Documentation](http://jonkomperda.github.com/PySimpleMAC/doxy)\r\n\r\nAlso it would be useful to refer to the full Fortran version of the code which may be located here:\r\n[SimpleMAC](https://github.com/jonkomperda/SimpleMAC)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis code was written for a graduate class at University of Illinois at Chicago.\r\nThe main author is Jon Komperda (@jonkomperda).\r\n\r\nI would also like to thank my undergraduate researcher Azeam Anjum (@aanjum2) for his contributions to the base solver of [SimpleMAC](https://github.com/jonkomperda/SimpleMAC), which this code is based on.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
